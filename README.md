# Research Software Development workshop

This repository contains material for running a research software development
workshop.

The material is based on a previous workshop which we designed with [@drvinceknight](https://twitter.com/drvinceknight)
& [@GeraintPalmer](https://twitter.com/GeraintPalmer). That workshop can be
found at https://vknight.org/rsd/.


# Installation

This workshop is written in [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org), however,
they are not required for the workshop.

The requirements (with installation notes) can be found at _add link_.

# Topics

The workshop covers:

- Basic use of the command line
- Best practice in writing computer code (the workshop uses Python but the ideas are applicable to any language)
- Version control with git
- Setting up a repository in GitHub with license, tests, README, etc
