# Research Software Development workshop

This repository contains material for running a research software development (rsd)
workshop.

The material is based on a previous rsd workshop which we designed with [@drvinceknight](https://twitter.com/drvinceknight)
& [@GeraintPalmer](https://twitter.com/GeraintPalmer). The material for the
previous workshop are available at https://vknight.org/rsd/.


# Installation

This workshop is written in [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org), however,
they are not required for the workshop.

The requirements with installation notes can be found at [Installation [pre workshop]](https://github.com/Nikoleta-v3/rsd-workshop/blob/master/Installation%20%5Bpre%20workshop%5D.ipynb).

# Topics

The workshop covers:

- Basic use of the command line
- Version control with git
- Best practice in writing computer code (the workshop uses Python but the ideas are applicable to any language)
- Setting up a repository in GitHub with license, tests, README, etc
