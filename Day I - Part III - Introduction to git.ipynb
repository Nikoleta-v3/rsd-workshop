Probably most of us have at some point in their career (some earlier, some later) come across as situation where they had to write document that evolved over time.It starts out simple, than more and more content comes in, often content needs to be reorganized, certain parts will be deleted or moved to other places. Changes introduced are reverted and changed in a different way etc. More often than not one wishes to travel back in time to an earlier stage in the history of the project. "
