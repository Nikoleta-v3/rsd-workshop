Software has become an important aspect of research. In a recent study by the 
Software Sustainability Institute it was found that 7 out
of 10 UK researchers would not be able to carry out their research without
software
(www.software.ac.uk/blog/2014-12-04-its-impossible-conduct-research-without-software-say-7-out-10-uk-researchers).

As more research is based on results that are generated by software, there must
be an increased focus on developing software that is reliable and which can be
easily proven to produce reproducible results. That is because the reproducibility of
research is at the very heart of the scientific method.

In order to create better software, good software practices are needed. This
workshop serves as an introduction to several software best practices.
